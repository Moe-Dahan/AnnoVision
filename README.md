# ANNOVISION
ANNOVISION is a tool built using Python's Tkinter library that facilitates the annotation of images for computer vision tasks. It provides a user-friendly interface for annotating images with bounding boxes and saving the annotations in a YOLOv8 dataset format.

# Features
- Open images from a selected folder for annotation.
- Annotate images by drawing bounding boxes around objects of interest.
- Assign class labels and colors to annotated objects.
- Save annotations and export them in YOLOv8 dataset format.
- User-friendly interface with intuitive controls.

# Installation
- Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/Moe-Dahan/annovision.git
- Navigate to the project directory: cd annovision
- Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
- Run the main.py file: python main.py
- Use the interface to open a folder containing images for annotation.
- Click and drag to draw bounding boxes around objects in the images.
- Assign class labels and colors to the annotated objects.
- Save the annotations (Control+s shortcut)
- Once All Images are annotated export them in YOLOv8 dataset format.
- Control+d to delete the last annoted data created.
